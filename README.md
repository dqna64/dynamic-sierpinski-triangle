# dynamic-sierpinski-triangle
Sierpinski triangle animation with vertex positions changing over time.

Uses a recursive branching function to rendering triangles within triangles.

Modulates triangle vertex positions along the parent triangle sides using a transformed inverse cosine function w.r.t. time.
